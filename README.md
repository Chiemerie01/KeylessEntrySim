# Simulink Model: Keyless Car Entry System

This project simulates the detection, authentication, and unlocking logic of a keyless car entry system using Simulink.

## Features
- Simulated key presence input
- Authentication logic and conditional unlocking
- Time delays to model real-world behavior
- Dashboard indicators and scope visualization

## How to Run
Open `keyless_entry_system.slx` in MATLAB Simulink. Run the model to simulate a 15-second key detection and entry cycle.
